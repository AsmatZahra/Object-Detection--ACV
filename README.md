# Advance Computer Vision Object Detection Projects
 Repository contains ACV projects of Object Detection
 # Background Knowledge:
  Def: 
      "Object Detection is modeled as a classification problem where we take windows of fixed sizes from input image at all the possible locations feed these patches to an image classifier. Each window is fed to the classifier which predicts the class of the object in the
window( or background if none is present). Hence, we know both the class and location of the objects in the image."
 # Why
  * To learn about the semantic Object Detection pipeline
  * Implementation of Object Detection pipeline on a real world dataset
 # Tools Used
  * [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
  * [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb)
  * [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/)
 # Language Used
  * Python 3.6
 # Dataset Used
 ## Introduction
 Satellite Imagery Multi-vehicles Dataset (SIMD). It comprises 5,000 images of resolution 1024
x 768 and collectively contains 45,303 objects in 15 different classes of vehicles including cars,
trucks, buses, long vehicles, various types of aircrafts and boats. The source images are taken
from public satellite imagery available in Google Earth and contain images of multiple
locations from seven countries.
